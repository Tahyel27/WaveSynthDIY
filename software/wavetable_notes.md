1. Implement a wavetable oscillator in both julia and the pico synth
2. research what the x coordinate in the fft means
3. test out aliasing in julia by playing the bandlimited signal
4. how does the fft x coordinate map onto harmonics when the table is played back at a given frequency?
5. implement reading from bandlimited multiwavetables
6. implement a wavetable index, with pointers to table start maybe?
